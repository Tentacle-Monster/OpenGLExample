small project about line cutting
if you are looking for BSUIR AKG LABS, you can just rewrite it

__2d_shapes_intersection__ - 2d shapes cropping with implimentation of Kirus-Back and Sazerlend-Coen alhorythms use left mouse button to drag and left to rotate, 'p' button to start/end the animation


__3d_shape_invisible_lines__ - 3d shape invisible lines cutting. Self- writen alhorythm based on depth calculation, with manual matrix multyplying top 3 sliders- positioning, next 3- rotation, next 3- scaling, and the last one - rotation around self axis(diagonal line)

both folders include all libs you need to compile and run it on windows separatly
